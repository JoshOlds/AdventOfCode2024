# Advent of Code 2024
## Using C# and Godot 4.3

This year, I am brushing up on my C# skills for use in the Godot game engine!

Solutions to each puzzle can be found in the '/scripts' folder. To run these, you will need to attach any of these scripts to a 'Node' object inside an active Godot scene.

I plan to add a GUI launcher to the application and include executables to run without needing the Godot editor in the future!
